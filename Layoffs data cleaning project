--2 Standardizing data 


--TRIM
Select company, TRIM(company)
From layoffs_staging


UPDATE layoffs_staging
SET company = TRIM(company)

--Updating industries because we had "Crypto Tech, Crypto currencies" changed it to "Crypto"

Select DISTINCT industry
From layoffs_staging

From layoffs_staging
WHERE industry LIKE 'Crypto%';


UPDATE layoffs_staging

--Updating date's data type and format


SELECT [date],
       CONVERT(Date, [date])
FROM layoffs_staging;

 
 Update layoffs_staging
 SET [date] = CONVERT(Date, [date])

 --DID't workout that is why I decided to crete new column "formatted date"

 -- Step 1: Add a new column to the table
ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging
ADD formatted_date VARCHAR(10); -- Assuming the desired format is 'MM/dd/yyyy'

-- Step 2: Update the new column with properly formatted dates
UPDATE layoffs_staging
SET formatted_date = CONVERT(varchar(10), [date], 101); -- Format '101' represents 'MM/dd/yyyy'



-- 3 Remove Null Values or blank values


SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging
where total_laid_off IS NULL
and percentage_laid_off = 'NULL'

SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging
Where industry is NULL
OR industry = ' '

FROM layoffs_staging
WHERE company = 'Airbnb'

SELECT * 
FROM layoffs_staging
WHERE company LIKE 'Bally%'

FROM layoffs_staging t1
JOIN layoffs_staging t2
    ON t1.company = t2.company
WHERE (t1.industry is NULL OR t1.industry = ' ')

FROM layoffs_staging t1
JOIN layoffs_staging t2 ON t1.company = t2.company
WHERE (t1.industry IS NULL OR t1.industry = ' ')
AND t2.industry IS NOT NULL;



-- Decided to delete rows that  have both "total_laid_off" and "percentage_laid_off" as NULL values
